## ‚ùì FAQ

* **Why do I need to reboot?**
  Certain profiles or files locked during cleanup are scheduled for deletion on next boot via `PendingFileRenameOperations`.

* **Will it delete my personal data?**
  It only targets specific user profiles (`server`, `moda`, `moba`), known malware paths, and registry keys tied to the malware. Always review prompts before confirming.

* **Can I use this in a domain environment?**
  This script manages **local** users and settings only. For Active Directory user removal, use `Remove-ADUser` or your domain management tools.
